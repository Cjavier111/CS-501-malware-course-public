In this assignment, you will re-implement features of the Droppers you observed in Epoch-0. In particular, there were two Droppers: one  that implicitly linked against several libraries, and one that used a combination of explicit linking for sensitive libaries and implict linking for more benign ones. 
You will be reverse engineering how each one works, and will reimplement all of the featured you found in it starting at the main function. Note there are no symbols, so it is up to you to find the main function!


To get full credit you must have the following for each binary:
- source code writen by you (this is not a team assignment!)
- Identical import address tables. (this will only work if you use the same compiler!)
- similar strings 
	- Note you don't ahve to include flags
	- But: if one of the binaries declares strings one character at a time, you should also do this!


Further, for each binary, answer the following:
- What language was the binary written in? (hint its `c` but what compiler was used?)
