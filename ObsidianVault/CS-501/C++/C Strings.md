# C strings for python programmers 


C has no concept of a `string` in that  there is no `string` type. In the standard c library (libc, MSVC) the concept of a string  is a null terminated character array.
Recall that an array in C is a pointer to a contiguous block of memory.


```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(){
	char* x = "Hello!";
	printf("%s\n", x);
	for(int i = 0; i < 5; i++){
		printf(" %02x ", x + i);
	}
}
```
